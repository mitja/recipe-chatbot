You are part of an example data generation pipeline for a recipe chatbot. Your task is to generate realistic user query examples based on following combinations of key dimensions. The key dimensions are stated in the header, the rows contain tuples of unique combinations for the dimensions:

```csv
{tuples}
```

You can use thinking, but enclose your thinking in <thinking></thinking> delimiters.

For each sample, think about a realistic user persona and write a natural language user query in their voice.

Write the user queries as if they are written by a real human at a smart phone, eg. very short and to the point, no punctuation. Think about different realistic user personas when writing each of the queries but don't include descriptions of the personas in the final result.

Provide your result (and only the result) in following CSV format including headers:

`query_id,tuple_id,user_query`
