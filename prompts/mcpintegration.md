Please implement a foundation for connecting the application to MCP servers.

Provide a simple test MCP server with simple token authentication as example and for testing. For your information: I plan to provide

an MCP server for a sqlite database to read recipes, nutrition data, and update meal plans and shopping lists (based on Anthropic's example implementation), and
an MCP server for getting current information about consumed foods
I'm happy to take your suggestions to improve the idea or answer questions if you need further information.
