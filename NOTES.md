# Notes

## Vibe Coding with Jules

- use Chrome - Safari on mac has bugs (eg. cannot enter input after a task has been started)
- can add directions after a branch has been created (not new task counted)
- nice: ran into a problem (in testing), fixed it...
- cannot run long-running processes
- there is a documentation...
- can configure / describe how to setup
- can continue after a push to branch
- branch names can be changed before pusing

## TODO

- implement webhook receiving data from FDDB
- keep a copy or use an mcp server to lookup data
- implement basic form views in chat for data entry, eg. age, weight, etc.
- family and membership must not be prompt-injectable
- implement shopping list
- implement meal plan
